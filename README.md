👋 Hi, I'm @Aimekayo24
  - 👀 I am interested in developing the game, I have a project (projects) that combines education, culture and entertainment through games and movies.
  - currently I am currently studying: programming, game design, animation and other important things in my project.
  - 💞️ I want to cooperate with my friends in technical development, construction and game plan. 
 NB: even though I have beginners I see interaction on the cultural game plan and technical development that would help me.
